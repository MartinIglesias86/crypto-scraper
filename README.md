# <h1 align="center"> :moneybag: Crypto Scraper :moneybag: </h1>
This is a simple scraper made entirely on Javascript to get the prices of the top 10 crypto coins listed on [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/ "CoinMarketCap's Home")

For this project I used the following libraries:<br>
* Axios<br>
* Express<br>
* Cheerio<br>

## :computer: How to run it?
Just copy the content of the repository in a folder in your computer, open a terminal at that folder and run
```
node index.js
```
:atom: After that just open your browser, go to "http://localhost:3000/api/price-feed" and you will see the information in a JSON format, ready to be picked up by any front end interface :tophat:
